	     We are making available a snapshot release of Trimaran (v.3.7)
           that includes more accurate tracking of the memory system
      performance. This release is being made available due to popular demand.<br>
           <br>
           There are various other features that were added (and bugs
      fixes) but not documented here. This release does pass our
      regression test suite and is fairly stable. Please report any
      problems directly to the <a href="support.html">support team</a>. A new Trimaran
      distribution will also be made available soon which will include
      support for clustered architectures.<br>
           <br>
           Note that as with all memory simulations, there are various
      details that are hard to simulate and you should understand the simulation
      infrastructure before reporting numbers for publications when
      memory simulation is enabled.
            The current
           distribution also includes the cache simulation interface from
           <a href="http://www.simplescalar.com">SimpleScalar</a> for those who wish to use it
           (this interface is activated via a compile time flag in the
           trimaran/simu/src/emulib/Makefile).<br> 
           <br>
           This snapshot release also includes more statistics
           tracking and a new format of the simulator output
           files. Note however that this new output is not compatible
           with the GUI visualization tools.<br>
