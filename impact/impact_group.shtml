      <br>
      The objective of IMPACT (Illinois Microarchitecture Project
      utilizing Advanced Compiler Technology) is to provide critical
      research, architecture expertise, and compiler prototypes for
      the microprocessor industry.  This objective is accomplished by
      analyzing and demonstrating the level of hardware and compiler
      support required by architectural enhancements in order to
      understand the cost and effectiveness of these enhancements.
      IMPACT's primary focus is on exposing, enhancing, and exploiting
      instruction-level parallelism (ILP).<br>
      <br>
      The IMPACT compiler framework was created by the
      <a href="http://www.crhc.uiuc.edu/IMPACT/">IMPACT research group</a>
      under the direction of
      <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/faculty/profile.asp?w-hwu">Professor Wen-mei
      W. Hwu</a>.  The IMPACT research group is affiliated with the
      <a href="http://www.crhc.uiuc.edu/">Center for Reliable and
      High-Performance Computing</a> which is part of the
      <a href="http://www.csl.uiuc.edu">Coordinated Science Laboratory</a>,
      an interdisciplinary research organization at the
      <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois at
      Urbana-Champaign</a>.  Wen-mei Hwu is a Professor at the
      <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu">Department of Electrical and
      Computer Engineering</a>.  Graduate students from the IMPACT research
      group are from either the Department of Electrical and Computer
      Engineering or the
      <a href="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu">Department of Computer Science</a>.
      Details about IMPACT team members, past and present,
      who developed this framework can be found at the IMPACT web page,

      The IMPACT public and Trimaran release effort (versions 1.00-2.33) was lead 
      by <a href="http://www.crhc.uiuc.edu/~gyllen"> Professor John
      Gyllenhaal</a>. 

      He would like to thank Professor Wen-mei W. Hwu for encouraging
      and supporting this release effort;   Brian Deitrich and  Daniel
      Lavery for leading and coordinating the IMPACT beta releases
      prior to May 1997;  John Sias,  Ben-Chung Cheng, <a
      href="http://ece-www.colorado.edu/~dconnors/">  Dan Connors</a>,
      <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~mahlke/">  Scott Mahlke</a>,
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~august/">  David
      August</a>, Liesl Little,  Matthew Merten,  Andy Trick,  Patrick
      Eaton,  Rick Hank,  Le-Chun Wu,  Qudus Olaniran</a>, Sabrina
      Hwu, and Jason  Fritts for their extensive help in making these
      releases stable and for graciously acting as sounding boards
      even when they were extremely busy with  their own research; and
      the IMPACT compiler team in general for all of their
      contributions, help, and support. He would also like to thank
      all the Trimaran  council members, especially Vinod Kathail,  Ralph
      Hyver, Tom Christian and Han-Soo
      Kim</a>, and the entire Trimaran team, especially <a
      href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rabbah/">Rodric Rabbah</a>, for
      their efforts to make the Trimaran release a success.<br>
      <br>

      Brian Deitrich, Daniel Lavery, and John Gyllenhaal would also
      like to thank the IMPACT  public release beta testers for all
      their feedback.<br>
      <br>

      The IMPACT research group thanks the
      National Science Foundation (NSF)  for supporting a significant
      portion of this release effort  under grant CCR-9809404.<br>
      <br> 

      The IMPACT compiler framework is the result of numerous
      research efforts by 45+ graduate students over the last ten
      years.  These research efforts were supported by the National
      Science Foundation (NSF) under grants CCR-9809478, CCR-9629948,
      MIP-930813, and MIP-8809478, Hewlett-Packard, Intel Corporation,
      Advanced Micro Devices, Microsoft, SUN Microsystems, NCR, Mazda
      Motor Corporation, Matsushita Electric Industrial Corporation,
      Joint Services Engineering Programs (JSEP) under contract
      N00014-90-J-1270, and the National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration (NASA) under Contract NASA NAG 1-613 in
      cooperation with the Illinois Computer Laboratory for Aerospace
      Systems and Software (ICLASS).<br> 
      <br> 

      The IMPACT compiler's C front end is built upon the <a
      href="http://www.edg.com">Edison Design Group's</a> C/C++ front
      end  (see <a
      href="http://www.crhc.uiuc.edu/IMPACT/ftp/software/EDG_CTOP_LICENSE">
      EDG_CTOP_LICENSE</a>).<br>
      <br> 

      IMPACT's predicate analysis makes extensive use of the <a
      href="http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/">CUDD-2.2.0</a> package
      developed at the University of Colorado at Boulder by Fabio
      Somenzi.<br>
      <br>

      The IMPACT compiler framework relies on the
      portable Lcode (IMPACT's IR) emulator, platform info framework,
      and the portability enhancements developed by IMPACT
      Technologies, Inc.  (see <a
      href="http://www.crhc.uiuc.edu/IMPACT/ftp/software/ITI_LICENSE">
      ITI_LICENSE</a>) to allow IMPACT's and Trimaran's IR to be
      emulated on a wide variety of platforms.
