    Michael Schlansker is a department-level scientist at HP Labs.  Since
    joining HP in 1989, Mike has worked on the development of
    high-performance computing technology.  The primary focus for early
    work was on architectures and compilers for general-purpose machines
    which exploit instruction-level parallelism.  This work resulted in
    the development of the Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing
    (EPIC) style of architecture that is the basis for IA-64.  More
    recently, Mike's work at HP focused on the automatic design of custom
    embedded processors.<br>

    Mike has involved in high performance computing technology throughout
    his career. After teaching at University of Illinois, he designed
    special-purpose computers for signal processing at ESL/TRW, and he
    designed high performance mini-supercomputers at Cydrome.  He has
    authored numerous patents and research publications in the area of
    architecture and compilers for high-performance computing.  Mike
    received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan.<br>
    <br>
    Mike has been involved with HPL-PD and Elcor since their inception. 
    Mike was responsible for many architectural features which are part
    of HPL-PD including novel aspects of the memory and predicate
    architecture.  His work within Elcor includes contributions to the
    overall architecture of the compiler as well as contributions to
    Tools, the machine description facility, the analysis of predicated
    code, and control CPR.<br>
