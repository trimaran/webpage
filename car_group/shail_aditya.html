    Shail Aditya Gupta received his B.Tech. in Computer Science and
    Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India, and
    his S.M., E.E.  and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA.  At MIT, Shail was a key
    contributor in the design and development of the implicitly-parallel
    dataflow language Id and its successor pH (parallel Haskell).  His
    research interests range from strongly typed programming languages
    and type inference systems to various aspects of parallel computing
    including the design of multi-threaded and VLIW compilers, processor
    architectures and parallel applications.<br>
    <br>
    In 1995, Shail joined Hewlett-Packard Labs as a Software Design
    Engineer in the Compiler and Architecture Research Group. Since then
    he has been working in the field of automatic design and synthesis of
    custom, application-specific, embedded processors and their
    programming environments. <br>
    <br>
    Shail's primary contribution to Trimaran was the MDES interface
    design and development. He also contributed towards the
    modulo-scheduler and the integration and testing framework for the
    Elcor backend.<br>
