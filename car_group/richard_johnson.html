    While at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Richard Johnson developed the
    predicate-sensitive data flow analysis and code generation modules
    within Elcor.  Richard received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from
    Cornell University in 1994; he received B.S. degrees in Mathematics
    and in Computer Science from North Carolina State University in
    1987.  His research interests include program analysis and
    optimization for VLIW architectures, compilation and architectures
    for cost-sensitive ILP embedded processors, and automated design of
    custom-fit embedded processors.<br>
