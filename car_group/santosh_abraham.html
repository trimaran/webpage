    Santosh Abraham is a Member of the Technical Staff at Hewlett Packard
    Laboratories.  Prior to joining HP Labs, Santosh taught at the
    University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  Santosh co-authored over 40
    papers in multiprocessor systems, optimizing compilers, performance
    evaluation, memory hierarchy simulation and design.  Santosh
    co-developed the widely used Cheetah cache simulator.  Santosh
    received a B.Tech degree from the Indian Institute of Technology,
    Bombay, M.S. from the State University of New York, Stony Brook, and
    Ph.D. from the University of Illinois, Urbana, all in Electrical
    Engineering.<br>
    <br>
    Memory structures of custom embedded systems contain buffer memories
    and local memories, in lieu of conventional caches.  Santosh's
    current research is in automating the design and compilation for such
    memory structures.<br>
    <br>
    Santosh was the primary designer and implementer of the Trimaran
    scheduler.  The Trimaran scheduler supports meld scheduling and a
    variety of scheduling algorithms, including back-tracking.  Santosh
    also developed a module to utilize memory dependence profiling
    information.<br>
    <br>
    Within Elcor, Santosh designed a module that reduces cache stalls by
    increasing the scheduling distance between loads that are likely to
    miss and their uses.  Santosh co-designed a module to utilize
    effectively the local memory ports in architectures that have a local
    memory in addition to a conventional memory hierarchy.  In the
    overall Pico framework, Santosh designed and implemented the Memory
    Spacewalker that automatically and efficiently evaluates a specified
    range of memory hierarchies using the Cheetah simulator and produces
    paretos for each level of the memory hierarchy as well as for the
    overall system.<br>
