The following presents a brief overview of Trimaran. A more elaborate
overview appears in 
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11532378_4">Lecture Notes in Computer
Science</a>.
<p align="justify">Trimaran is an integrated compiler and simulation infrastructure for
research in computer architecture and compiler optimizations. Trimaran
is highly parameterizable, and can target a wide range of
architectures that embody embedded processors, high-end VLIW
processors, and multi-clustered architectures. Trimaran also
facilitates the exploration of the architecture design space, and is
well suited for the automatic synthesis of programmable application
specific architectures. It allows for customization of all aspects of
an architecture, including the datapath, control path, instruction
set, interconnect, and instruction/data memory subsystems.
<p align="justify">
The modular nature of the compiler and the hierarchical intermediate
program representation used throughout makes the construction and
insertion of new compilation modules into the compiler especially
easy. Trimaran is already populated with a large number of existing
compilation modules, providing leverage for new compiler research as
well as education in advanced compiler topics. The Trimaran Graphical
User Interface (GUI) makes the configuration and use of the system
surprisingly easy.
<p align="justify">
Among the rich suite of compiler analysis and optimizations are:
<ul>
<li>Advanced region formation algorithms (e.g., superblocks and
hyperblocks) to expose instruction level parallelism with speculation
and predication.</li>
<li>Various backend instruction partitioning and mapping algorithms
for automatically distributing parallelism in a multi-clustered
architecture.</li>
<li> A first of its kind <a href="http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/slarsen/Larsen-PhD.pdf">backend vectorizer</a> that extracts and
exploits data level parallelism using short vector instructions (SIMD).</li>
<li>Various register allocation heuristics.</li>
<li>Instruction scheduling algorithms including software pipelining
with modulo scheduling.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
Although there are several compiler infrastructures available to the
research community, Trimaran is unique in that it is especially geared
toward compiler and architecture research. Trimaran is used for
designing, implementing, and testing new optimizations, as well as the
evaluation of various architectural innovations. Trimaran is also
widely used for teaching and education purposes at several
universities worldwide.

<p align="justify">
We are committed to releasing a robust, tested, and documented
system. Our website (http://www.trimaran.org) provides the latest
information on Trimaran, and includes links to download the system, as
well as documentation and other useful resources.
<p>
The following is a summary of the newest Trimaran features made
available in an current release (dated 12/16/2007).
<ul>
<li>Support for multi-cluster architectures. The clusters can be
organized as either sharing an inter-cluster communication bus or
a mesh point-to-point operand network.</li>
<li>Support for application-specific instruction-set extensions.</li>
<li>Support for automatic vectorization.</li>
<li>Support for Fortran applications via a SUIF to Trimaran
  translator.</li>
<li>Advanced simulation of the memory system using the <a href="http://m5.eecs.umich.edu/">M5 simulator</a>.</li>
<li>Code generation infrastructure to handle ISAs with arbitrary literal
bit-width constraints.</li>
<li>Code generation for the ARM ISA.</li>
<li>New datatype attribute associated with every operand to describe
the data type (integer/float/predicate), whether the operand is signed
or unsigned, and the operand bit-width.</li> 
<li>Support for the <tt>long long</tt> datatype.</li>
<li>Register allocation has been 
completely rewritten and many optimizations have been added to the
default path.</li>
<li>Significantly improved code quality.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
