    Rob Schreiber is a Project Scientist at Hewlett Packard
    Laboratories.  He received an A.B. in mathematics from Cornell (1972),
    and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Yale (1977).  He is known for
    important basic research in sequential and parallel algorithms for
    matrix computation and in compiler optimization for data-parallel
    languages.  He is a contributor to the Matlab scientific computing
    environment, and is a co-developer of the High Performance Fortran
    programming language.  He has written over eighty scientific papers.
    He is on the editorial boards of three journals in the scientific and
    supercomputing fields, and is area editor for scientific computing of
    the Journal of the ACM.<br>

    Rob was previously a senior scientist at the Research Institute for
    Advanced Computer Science, NASA Ames Research Center, where he
    received the 1994 H. Julian Allen Award as co-author of the
    outstanding research paper at Ames.  He has held faculty positions at
    Stanford and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, was the chief
    scientist of Saxpy Computer Corporation, and has extensive consulting
    experience in the high-performance computer industry.<br>
    <br>
    Rob has worked in the Elcor and Trimaran areas on a SUIF-based front
    end for exploiting loop-level parallelism, in order to enable the
    synthesis of application-specific arrays of VLIW processors. Rob has
    been the chief architect of an HP Labs prototype system in this area,
    as well as the designer and implementor of many of the processor
    scheduling and allocation algorithms employed by this system.<br>
