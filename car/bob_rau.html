    B. Ramakrishna (Bob) Rau is a senior research scientist at HP Labs,
    where he holds the title of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Scientist.
    He is also the manager of HP Labs' Compiler and Architecture Research
    (CAR) group.<br>
    <br>
    On joining HP in 1989, Bob started HP Lab's research program in VLIW
    and instruction-level parallel (ILP) processing.  This resulted in
    the development of the Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing
    (EPIC) style of architecture that is the basis for the IA-64.  Bob's
    current research interests lie in evolving and adapting the EPIC
    architecture and compiler technologies, and the systolic array
    technology, to enable the automatic architecting of custom,
    application-specific, embedded processors.<br>
    <br>
    Bob was a co-founder of Cydrome Inc. which developed and productized
    one of the first VLIW mini-supercomputers, the Cydra 5. He has taught
    at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, where he currently
    is an Adjunct Professor.  He has twelve patents, numerous research
    publications in the area of VLIW computing, and has co-edited a book
    on instruction-level parallelism.  He received his B.Tech degree from
    the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, and his MS and
    Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University. <br>
    <br>
    Bob's primary contributions to Trimaran have been to create the
    environment which enabled the research leading to the development of
    EPIC, HPL-PD and Elcor, and in forging the research relationships
    with the University of Illinois and New York University which have
    resulted in Trimaran. He has made contributions to Elcor/Trimaran on
    topics such as region-based compiling, dynamic single assignment
    (DSA) and expanded virtual registers (EVRs), modulo scheduling,
    rotating register allocation, and machine description databases
    for machine description-driven compilation.<br>
