    Scott Mahlke is a research engineer in the Compiler and Architecture
    Research group at HP Laboratories.  He joined HP Labs in 1995 after
    attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  He
    received his Ph.D., M.S., and B.S. degrees from the Department of
    Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois.
    He is best known for his work on speculative and predicated execution
    to facilitate exploiting ILP in general-purpose programs.  Scott's
    research interests include: EPIC architectures, predicated execution,
    compiler optimization and scheduling, and design of
    application-specific processors.<br>
    <br>
    Scott was in a unique position within Trimaran as both a former
    member of the Impact group and a member of the CAR group to provide
    contributions in both the Impact and Elcor infrastructures.  On the
    Impact side, he helped define and develop the machine independent,
    low-level representation, Lcode.  He also led the development of the
    following Impact components: the machine independent classic
    optimizer, the superblock and hyperblock formation modules, the
    superblock/hyperblock ILP optimizer, and the HPL-PD code generator.
    On the Elcor side, he set up the bridge between the Impact and Elcor
    compilers to enable the two infrastructures to effectively
    inter-operate in a coherent system.<br>
    <br>
    He also contributed to Elcor in the following areas: control flow
    analysis and transformations, if-conversion, run-time statistics
    collection, the REBEL textual representation, control critical path
    reduction (CPR), and data height reduction.<br>
