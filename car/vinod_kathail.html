    Vinod Kathail is a Project Scientist in the Compiler and Architecture
    Research group at HP Laboratories.  Since joining HP, he has been
    working on ILP architectures and compilers for both general-purpose
    and embedded computing.  He was a key contributor in the development
    of the Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) that is the
    basis for IA64 and is the primary author of the HPL-PD architecture
    report.  He has been instrumental in the development of Elcor
    compiler, which constitutes most of the machine-dependent part of the
    Trimaran research infra-structure.  Vinod holds 5 patents and has
    numerous research publications in the areas of VLIW architectures and
    compilers, dataflow architectures and functional languages.<br>
    <br>
    His research interests include EPIC architectures and compiler
    technology, automatic architecting and synthesis of
    application-specific processors for embedded computing, and
    programming languages and their implementations.  Vinod received his
    B.Tech degree from MACT, Bhopal, his M.Tech from Indian Institute of
    Technology, Kanpur, and his Sc.D.  in computer science from
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.<br>
    <br>
    Vinod leads HP Labs Trimaran effort.  He has been the Chief Architect
    of Elcor and has been managing its development since its inception. 
    He designed Elcor's internal representation which provides full
    support for region-based compilation.  He also contributed to Elcor
    in the areas of meld-scheduling, modulo scheduling, region-based
    register allocation, machine description system for machine
    description-driven compilation, and region-based compiling.<br>
